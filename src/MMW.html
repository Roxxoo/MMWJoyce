             <p class="font-textbody">As you can see, 
                we have done a significant amount of work for this subject and 
                I am happy with what I've accomplished with my group mates and classmates.
                 With the patterns task, I was surprised with how creative the images came out.
                  It was a mixture of laughter, confusion, and awe. 
                  It was totally not what I expected. 
                 </p>
                 <p class="font-textbody"> I also learned about logic gates,
                    something I heard about from other technical majors such as 
                    Information Technology, Engineering, or Computer Science. I did not expect that I would be learning it too. 
                    It was confusing at first because of how the gates worked and how they 
                    outputted the correct value, but once I got the hang of it I had found myself enjoying it. 
                    </p> 
                 <p class="font-textbody">The data analytics part was a bit tricky for us though. How were we going to do the analytics,
                    do the computations, do the data gathering, and coming up with the interview questions or other ways we can
                    gather information. The hardest part was by far, the computations. Me and my group were not really the best 
                    in arithmetic so we had a bit of a struggle there. Though, it was quite satisfying when we started to get the ball rolling.
                    It was great to see that we achieved what we wanted to. I was the one who was assigned to do the computations, this is why I said earlier that it was challenging.
                    Not only was I not the best in math, there was also another final exam that was having a bit of overlap with the project time.
                    </p>
                <p class="font-textbody">The comic strip was enjoying for me and my group as well. I never made a comic before ever, even if this was
                    made with the help of a comic generator. We had to think of the layout, we had to visualize the script, how it was all going to flow.
                    Though it was a short comic, we still gave a lot of thought before making it. The script making part was enjoyable. There was a lot of
                    hilarious suggestions that did not make it. The tool was a bit odd, it was missing some features that we would have liked. It was also a bit janky, but that is where my complaints end.
                    </p>
                <p class="font-textbody">   As you may conclude based on the reflection I made, most of the tasks were group works, so majority of the enjoyment came from our interactions with each other.
                    Sometimes members were hard to reach and some were unresponsive. So other members had to pick up the extra work. Good thing there was an evaluation at the end where we can give credit to the ones who took more than their fair share of work. 
                    Also, sometimes the activities came in late so we needed to rush the activities and other projects given. It felt like we were always chasing.</p>
              
                <p class="font-textbody">The professor is considerate with the deadlines and overall is not bad. Only complaint is the deadlines, not because I'm lazy or anything, it's just there are some other people who can't work on schedule or as expected.
                
                That's all for my reflection. I enjoyed the subject, and a big thank you to Professor Karen Christine Henson!
